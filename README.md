# Predicting Strokes: Insights from the Data

Stroke Prediction plays a pivotal role in predicting the likelihood of an individual experiencing a stroke. Strokes, as the second leading cause of death globally, accounting for approximately 11% of total deaths according to the World Health Organization (WHO), represent a critical healthcare challenge.

The 'Stroke Prediction Dataset' was sourced from Kaggle which can be accessed at: Kaggle Dataset Link and emerged as the most suitable choice due to its alignment with the primary focus of stroke prediction and prevention. This dataset encompasses a wide array of attributes, including demographic information, medical history, and lifestyle factors.

This dataset comprises 5110 records and 12 columns featuring both numerical and categorical data. It includes critical information such as unique identifiers, gender, age, medical conditions (hypertension and heart disease), marital status, occupation, residence type, glucose levels, BMI, smoking status, and stroke occurrences. Its primary objective is to unveil relationships between these factors and the likelihood of a stroke.
